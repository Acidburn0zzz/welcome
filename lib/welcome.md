# Welcome to the Atom Private Alpha!

You are one of the first people to try out GitHub's new text editor! Here is
what you need to know.

1. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles
the command palette, which lists every Atom command. Yes, you can try it now!
Press `cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the
`markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

2. We want your feedback! If you have anything positive or negative to say click
on the `send feedback` button at the bottom right of this window.

3. Here is where you can get more help with Atom

  * The [Atom docs](https://www.atom.io/docs/latest/) contain Guides and an API
reference.
  * [Atom Campfire Room](https://github.campfirenow.com/room/582204). Chat Atom
developers and other private alpha users.
  * [Atom Repo](https://github.com/atom/atom). Check out the source or create
an issue.
  * [Atom Org](https://github.com/atom). This is where all Atom related repos
are stored.

4. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the `command palette` and search
for `Welcome`.
