# Welcome to the Atom Private Alpha!

You are one of the first people to try out GitHub's new text editor! Here is
some information to help you out.

1. Keep Atom a secret! We aren't ready to publicly announce Atom yet so kept
this application on the down low.

3. We want your feedback! {Point out feedback icon} {Talk about diary study}
{Describe how we Atom will periodically send usage metrics}

4. If you only remember one keybinding make it `cmd-shift-P`. This toggles the
command palette, which lists every Atom command. Go ahead and try it now! Press
`cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. This triggers
`markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

5. Here is where you can get help with Atom
