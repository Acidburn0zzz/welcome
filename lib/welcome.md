# Welcome to the Atom Beta!

You are one of the first people to use GitHub's new text editor! Here is what
you need to know.

1. If you only remember one thing make it `cmd-shift-P`. This keystroke toggles
the command palette, which lists every Atom command. Yes, you can try it now!
Press `cmd-shift-P`, type `markdown` and press enter. It will trigger the
`markdown-preview:show` command which renders this text to HTML.

2. We want your feedback! If you have anything positive or negative to say click
on the `send feedback` button at the bottom right of this window.

3. Here is where you can get more help with Atom

  * The [Atom docs](https://www.atom.io/docs) contain Guides and an API
reference.
  * `##atom` the [Atom IRC Channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##atom).
Chat with other Atom developers on freenode.
  * The [Atom Org](https://github.com/atom). This is where all GitHub created Atom
packages are stored.

4. If you ever want to see this buffer again use the command palette
(`cmd-shift-P`) and search for `Welcome`.
